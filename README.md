- 👋 Hi, I’m @CSC2-PyHive
- 👀 I’m interested in cloud network security, cybersecurity, 3D printing and modeling, assisting military transitions, and teaching cooking.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning IT certifications, including Security+, Linux, Microsoft Azure and AI, and Splunk.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to cybersecurity, especially cloud network security. I'm also open to collaborating on projects related to 3D printing, military transition assistance, or cooking.

- ⚡ Fun fact: As a transition military officer, I enjoy helping others navigate their own transitions. I also have a passion for cooking and teaching others new culinary skills.
